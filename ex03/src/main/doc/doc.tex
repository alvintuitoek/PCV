\maketitle

In this exercise a camera calibration is realized using a direct linear transformation. 
The task consisted of generating the projection matrix from selfmade images 
and finding with this the interior and exterior orientation, 
such that geometric measurements can be made with the used camera and lens set.

\section{Image Acquisition:}

For the beginning, we were asked to take pictures with a digital camera,
which show an appropriate calibration object. 
We decided to use two different kinds of camera lens.
Firstly, a zoom lens, which has been locked at 100mm, such that it can't change
during several fotos.
Secondly, a Canon Lens EF 50mm fix lens.
Those generated input pictures can be seen in fig. ~\ref{fig:Input pictures}.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Input pictures using two different camera lens.}
  \label{fig:Input pictures}
\end{figure}

In the fokus, one can see a tabel, which we intended to be our 
appropriate calibration object. It should become visible, 
that the table's feet in the left picture are not stright at all,
which is a lense specific disturbance.
The table's feet in the right picture are only minimal disturbed.
The calibration object is described in the following.

a) Describe the acquired calibration object in brief.

As calibration object, we have modified a proper table from IKEA called \emph{LACK Couchtisch}.
It has a squared tabletop of the size of about 50cm and it has four feet, originally.
For the use as calibration object, we dismantled the table foot
that was in the foreground, such that one can see the room below the table easily.
The table was turned around, such that one can see the room enter the three table feet 
and the tabletop. Its total height is about 45cm.

The detailed dimensions can be found in the pictures itself:
For an easy and correct point estimation, the real points have been measured with a tape measure
and they have been put on green papers next to the positions.
Each coordinate set is connected by the real point by an arrow,
such that one can eassily see the measured coordinates in the picture itself.

The two pictures have been taken by a camera that is specified in the following.

b) Specify important technical information of the used camera
(i.e. type, resolution, etc.)

\begin{enumerate}
       \item model               = Canon EOS 550D.
       \item kind                = Digital single-lens reflex.
       \item sensor              = CMOS APS-C 22.3 x 14.9mm (1.6x conversion factor)
       \item resolution          = 5,184 x 3,456 (17.9 recorded [[megapixels]])
       \item lens 1              = Zoom (SigmaDC 18-2Canon Lens EF 50mm) Locked at 18mm lens
       \item lens 2              = Canon Lens EF 50mm fix lens
       \item ISO range           = ISO 100 to 6400 (expandable to 12800)
       \item flash               = Canon EOS flash system E-TTL II automatic built-in pop-up
       \item Metering modes      = Evaluative, Spot (4 percent at center), Partial (9 percent at center), Center-weighted average
       \item Focus areas         = 6 AF points, f/5.6 cross-type center (extra sensitivity at f/2.8)
       \item Focus modes 	 = AI Focus, One-Shot, AI Servo, Live View
       \item Continuous shooting = 3.7 frame/s for 34 JPEG or 6 RAW frames
\end{enumerate}

\section{Control point measurements:}

Then, we were asked to determine the three-dimensional object coordinates of at least 6 known
control points and their two-dimensional image coordinates. 
Those point correspondences can be found in fig. ~\ref{fig:Point Correspondences}
considering each input image.

  \caption{Point Correspondences.}
  \label{fig:Point Correspondences}
\end{figure}

For a better understanding, those point correspondences have been 
visualized in fig. ~\ref{fig:Point Correspondences}
considering each input image as well.

a) How did you define the axes of the object coordinate system?

The axes of the object coordinate system have been defined in a way,
that the point of origin was situated in that intersection of the tabletop and the table's feet
that was in the very back. This point was the fifth point fig. in ~\ref{fig:Point Correspondences}.

Hence, the x axis connects the points five and six,
the y axis connects the points five and four and
the z axis connects the points five and two.

Because of the rectangle of the tabletop and its feet,
this definition was the easies one and offered the most correct measurement possibilities.

b) How precise where the object coordinates measured?

The object coordinates were measured as precise as it was possible
without using any special gadgets. We used a measure tape,
measured only stright distances and ensured to use only rectangular site relations.

Indeed, for a very precise measurement, we have had to measure the exact angles 
of the axis definition additionally, we have had to proof the strightness
of the tabletop and its single feet and we have had to take care about small
production lacks and corners in the table. 
Because of their disturbance potential of only a few milimeters,
we decided to continue our work based on the given materials.

\section{Computation of the Projection Matrix:}

Implement a function in C++ for spatial resection using the direct linear
estimation method of the projection matrix with help of the singular value
decomposition.

  \subsection{Conditioning}

  In the beginning, the interesting point correspondence matrices are computed for conditioning.
  One for each specific lens.
  These matrices include two transformations: 
  Firstly, the translation of the centroid of all points to the origin.
  
  Secondly, this function realizes the the scaling of the mean distance to origin to one.

  \subsection{Create design matrix}

  The design matrix is built as follows: \\
  \begin{align}
  A_{i}=
  \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
  -\tilde{w}'\tilde{X_i^T} & 0 & \tilde{u_i}'\tilde{X_i^T} \\
  0 & -\tilde{w}'\tilde{X_i^T} & \tilde{v_i}'\tilde{X_i^T}
  \end{array} \right) 
  \end{align}

  \subsection{Solve equation system with SVD and Reshape}

  The linear homogeneous equation system is solved with the Single Value Decomposition.
  \begin{align}
  Ap=0, p=(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,j,k,l)^T 
  \end{align}

  Afterwards, the reshape is realized with this function as well.
  \begin{align}
  \tilde{P}=
  \left( \begin{array}{cccc}
  a & b & c & d \\
  e & f & g & h \\ 
  i & j & k & l
  \end{array} \right)
  \end{align}

  \subsection{Deconditioning}
In order to get back to the original coordinates, a final transformation matrix $H$ 
that is Euclidean normalized is calculated as follows:
\begin{align}
P=T'^{-1}\tilde{P}T
\end{align}

After all steps, the final projection matrix P looks like in the folloging:

\begin{align}
P=
\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
p_{11} & p_{12} & p_{13} & p_{14} \\
p_{21} & p_{22} & p_{23} & p_{24} \\
p_{31} & p_{32} & p_{33} & p_{34}
\end{array} \right) 
\end{align}
In the following section, we refer to P's elements using the following nomenclature:\\
$p_1=[p_{11} \  p_{21} \  p_{31}]^T$, $p_2=[p_{12} \  p_{22} \  p_{32}]^T$, $p_3=[p_{13} \  p_{23} \  p_{33}]^T$ and $p_4=[p_{14} \  p_{24} \  p_{34}]^T$.\\
$m^{3}=[p_{31} \  p_{32} \  p_{33}]$ and $M=[p_{1} \  p_{2} \  p_{3}]$.

W.r.t. the used two lenses, the specific projection matrices can be seen in the following:

\begin{tabular}{ l || p{7cm} || p{6cm}}
      Matrix & Zoom (SigmaDC 18-2Canon Lens EF 50mm) Locked at 18mm & Canon Lens EF 50mm \\
      \hline
      $P$ & $\approx
\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
 6.73    & 25.77     &  -2.98    & 1753.2505    \\
-2.11    &  2.35     & -24.07    & 1201.3021    \\
-0.00    &  0.004     &  -0.001   &    0.7452
\end{array} \right)$  &  
$\approx
\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
13.26    & 20.74    &  -1.29  & 1465.709 \\
1.85     & -1.56    & -23.88  & 1136.5 \\
-0.025    &  0.002    &  -0.0007  &    0.64
\end{array} \right)$  \\
\end{tabular}


\section{Interpretation of the Projection Matrix:}

Before the projection matrix can be interpreted, it has to be factorized using a RQ-decomposition.
Hence, in the following, firstly, a RQ-decomposition will be applied on the found projection matrix.
Having then the the calibration matrix R and the rotation matrix Q,
all eleven parameters of the interior and exterior orientation are derived.
Although the projection center already could be derived, it is done together with the other derivations.

But first of all, the RQ-decomposition is applied.

The upper triangular matrix R can be used for the derivation of the interior orientation.
Hence, it can also be called as the calibration matrix K. that can be seen in the following:
\begin{align}
R=K=
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
a_x & s   & x_0 \\
0   & a_y & y_0 \\
0   & 0   & 1
\end{array} \right) 
\end{align}

W.r.t. the used two lenses, the specific calibration matrices can be seen in the following:

\begin{tabular}{ l ||p{7cm} || p{6cm}}
      Matrix & Zoom (SigmaDC 18-2Canon Lens EF 50mm) Locked at 18mm & Canon Lens EF 50mm \\
      \hline
      $K$ & $\approx
\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
22.99 & -0.244 & 13.776841 \\
 0        & 22.56   & 8.98 \\
 0        &  0          & 0.006
\end{array} \right)$  &  
$\approx
\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
23.96 & -0.19 & 5.79 \\
 0        & 23.52   & 4.78 \\
 0        &  0          & 0.002
\end{array} \right)$  \\
\end{tabular}

Hence, the first five parameters can be derived as follows:

\begin{tabular}{ l l || p{6cm} || p{6cm}}
      No       & parameter                     & Zoom (SigmaDC 18-2Canon Lens EF 50mm) Locked at 18mm & Canon Lens EF 50mm \\
      \hline
      1.)      & principle distance $a_x$      & =22.9907   &  =23.9607px \\
      2.)      & skew $s$                      & =-0.244733 &  =-0.185831   \\
      3.)  4.) & principle point ($x_0, y_0$)  & =(13.776841; 8.9798031)px &  =(5.7922163; 4.7773986)px\\
      5.)      & aspect ratio $\gamma=a_y/a_x$ & =0.981189 &  =0.981761 
\end{tabular}

The orthogonal matrix Q can be used for the derivation of the exterior orientation.
Hence, it can also be called as the rotation matrix R that can be seen in the following:
\begin{align}
Q=R=Q_z^TQ_y^TQ_x^T 
\end{align}
So the rotation matrix R includes the single rotations along the z axis using $Q_z^T$,
along the y axis using $Q_y^T$ and along the x axis using $Q_x^T$.

W.r.t. the used two lenses, the specific rotation matrices can be seen in the following:

\begin{tabular}{ l || p{6cm} || p{6cm}}
      Matrix & Zoom (SigmaDC 18-2Canon Lens EF 50mm) Locked at 18mm & Canon Lens EF 50mm \\
      \hline
      $R$ & $\approx
\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
 0.71 &  0.71 &  0.007 \\
 0.18 & -0.17 & -0.97 \\
-0.69  &  0.69 & -0.25
\end{array} \right)$  &  
$\approx
\left( \begin{array}{cccc}
 0.72 &  0.69 &  0.01 \\
 0.22 & -0.21 & -0.96  \\
-0.66 &  0.69 & -0.30
\end{array} \right)$  \\
\end{tabular}

Hence, the next three parameters can be derived as follows:

\begin{tabular}{ l l || p{6cm} || p{6cm}}
      No & parameter & Zoom (SigmaDC 18-2Canon Lens EF 50mm) Locked at 18mm & Canon Lens EF 50mm \\
      \hline
      6.) & $\omega=atan(-r_{32}/r_{33})$ & =1.22634rad &  =1.16297rad \\
      7.) & $\phi=asin(r_{31})$ & =-0.755249rad &  =-0.726803rad  \\
      8.) & $\kappa=atan(-r_{21}/r_{11})$ & =-0.248502rad & =-0.290129rad
\end{tabular}

The projection matrix P can be used for the derivation of the center $C=(X_0,Y_0,Z_0,W_0)$
and with this for the completing of the exterior orientation.
\begin{align}
c_i=(-1)^i det(\tilde{P}_i), 
\end{align}
where $\tilde{P}_i$ is the matrix P without column i for i=1,...,4.
Hence, the derivation of the last three parameters can be seen in the following:

\begin{tabular}{ l l || p{6cm} || p{6cm}}
      No & parameter & Zoom (SigmaDC 18-2Canon Lens EF 50mm) Locked at 18mm & Canon Lens EF 50mm \\
      \hline
      9.) & $X_0=det[p2,p3,p4]$ & =-90.238335 &  =-187.77623 \\
      10.) & $Y_0=det[p1,p3,p4]$ & =0 & =   0       \\
      11.) & $Z_0=det[p1,p2,p4]$ & =0 & =   0       \\
      Add.) & $W_0=det[p1,p2,p3]$ & =1 &=   1
\end{tabular}

a.) Explain the geometric meaning of the extracted parameters in brief.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[1)] The principle distance $a_x$ is the perpendicular distance of the projection center
to the image plane.
\item[2)] The skew $s$ gives the twist of the x axis relativ to the y axis.
\item[3 + 4)] The position of the principle point ($x_0$, $y_0$) is given by the section of the 
viewing direction $Z_c$ with the image plane.
\item[5)] The aspect ratio $\gamma=a_y/a_x$ gives the ratio between the space angles covered
by one pixel in the x- w.r.t the y-axis.
\item[6 + 7 + 8)] The spatial rotation angles $\omega$, $\phi$, $\kappa$ are standing for euler rotation of the camera coordinate system in the
world coordinate system. Hence, they are part of the exterior orientation.
\item[9)] The component $X_0$ is the first spatial component of the position of the projection center C.\\
\item[10)] The component $Y_0$ is the second spatial component of the position of the projection center C.\\
\item[11)] The component $Z_0$ is the third spatial component of the position of the projection center C.\\
\item[Add.)] The component $W_0$ is the homogeneous part of the position of the projection center C.\\
\end{enumerate} 

b.) Evaluate the whole calibration process. How precise is the camera
orientation determined and where does the quality depend on?

All in all, the whole calibration process does not try to model the physics of the real world
(e.g. the exact light ray changes of a combination of several lenses).
For all the complex changes, there is used just one simple projection matrix.
Its calculation, use and interpretation is very easy and simplifies a lot,
but is for very exact calculations not the ideal choice.

The whole calibration process is very imprecise.
All corresponding points from the picture to the real world are selected manually 
by clicking on the associated area in the image.
To do this, in a proper way is very difficult. In consequence, the camera orientation
is not very precise determined.\\
In order to get an impression how precise the camera orientation is determined,
we compared the 11 parameters of a first run with the 11 parameters of a second run.
The differences of the two runs are visualized in the following table:

\begin{tabular}{ l l || p{4cm} || p{3.5cm}}
      No & Changed parameter & Zoom (SigmaDC 18-2Canon Lens EF 50mm) Locked at 18mm & Canon Lens EF 50mm \\
      \hline
               & 2d point differences          & (6;0),(-6;5),(16;0),(6;6), (-6;6),(-5;0)px   &  (0;-6),(0;5),(5;0),(5;-5),(0;0),(0;0)px \\
      1.)      & principle distance $a_x$      & =-0.0597px   &  =-0.0187px \\
      2.)      & skew $s$                      & =-0.0385 &  =0.2182   \\
      3.)  4.) & principle point ($x_0, y_0$)  & =(-0.0406; 0.2907)px &  =(0.1665; 0.3916)px\\
      5.)      & aspect ratio $\gamma=a_y/a_x$ & =0.0022 &  =-0.0011 \\
      6.) & $\omega=atan(-r_{32}/r_{33})$ & =-0.0085rad &  =-0.01176rad \\
      7.) & $\phi=asin(r_{31})$ & =-0.0063rad &  =0.0036rad  \\
      8.) & $\kappa=atan(-r_{21}/r_{11})$ & =-0.0043rad & =-0.0096rad \\
      9.) & $X_0=det[p2,p3,p4]$ & =0.9731 &  =6.1444 \\
      10.) & $Y_0=det[p1,p3,p4]$ & =0 & =   0       \\
      11.) & $Z_0=det[p1,p2,p4]$ & =0 & =   0       \\
      Add.) & $W_0=det[p1,p2,p3]$ & =1 &=   1
\end{tabular}

In the end, the quality depends on the following points:
\begin{itemize} 
\item The exactness of the image point selection by the computer mouse fulfilled by the human. 
\item Differences of the ideal model of central perspective (e.g. radial symmetric distortion).
\item Distortions through the camera lenses.
\end{itemize}
